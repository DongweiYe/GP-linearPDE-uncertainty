# Gaussian process regression with input inference

### TODO
1. Correct the variance computing (Done?)
2. First add setting with noise dependent problem (Done?)
3. Extend the example problem to multi-dimensional problem (Done?)
4. Using other MCMC to accelerate the posterior estimation (Gibb, HMC), also update with MH, the likelihood may not be symmetric
5. Update the way to compute input posterior distribution (likelihood estimation)
